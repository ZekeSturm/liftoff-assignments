### Features
 1 - Users may create persistent accounts - these accounts save scheduled items from groups they are in, as well as individually scheduled items the user creates and displays them on a home page. Conflict detection will tell persistent users if they have overbooked a time.
 2 - Users may create groups for persistent or temporary event scheduling, based on repeating weekly, monthly, or date range/individual dates. Groups will have admins (The creating member, permissions may be granted to others) who can request time from group members if the members allow it. Allow showing blocks of free time without hard scheduling, possibly
 3 - Temporary "accounts" (no persistence beyond the group, essentially just username) and groups may be created a la when 2 meet.
